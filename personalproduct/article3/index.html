            <h2>Understanding Backpropagation:</h2>
            <p>At its core, backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used for training artificial neural networks. It enables the network to learn from its mistakes by iteratively adjusting the weights of its connections. The key principle driving backpropagation is error minimization, aiming to reduce the difference between the predicted and actual outputs of the network.</p>

            <h2>Multivariable Calculus and Backpropagation:</h2>
            <p>To comprehend the inner workings of backpropagation, one must explore its mathematical underpinnings in multivariable calculus. The chain rule, a fundamental concept in calculus, serves as the backbone of the backpropagation algorithm. The chain rule allows for the calculation of gradients, which are essential in determining how changes in the network's parameters affect the overall error.</p>
            <p>The backpropagation process involves two main steps: the forward pass and the backward pass. During the forward pass, input data is propagated through the neural network, producing an output. The error between the predicted and actual output is then computed. In the backward pass, the algorithm traverses the network backward, calculating the gradients of the error with respect to the weights using the chain rule. These gradients guide the adjustment of weights to minimize the error in subsequent iterations.</p>
