					<h2>How Google Maps Works</h2>
					<p>Google Maps is an easily accessible modern tool that is often overlooked in day to day life, however Google Maps is an excellent example of how different branches of mathematics and computer science can be applied to create useful products. This article explores the inner workings of Google Maps and delves into the key role that the branch of mathematics known as graph theory plays. Discover how Google Maps uses the famous graph theory based Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between locations. Learn how Google Maps employs mathematics and computer science to improve route planning, providing users with accurate, efficient and navigation options.</p>

					<h2>Divide and Conquer</h2>
					<p>Often times, when facing an overwhelming problem, it can be a good idea to break the problem down into more manageable pieces. This practice is commonly used by software engineers when building a complex computer system. The two powerful algorithms, Merge Sort and Binary Search gain permformance by using this technique.In this article, we'll embark on a journey to understand these algorithms. We'll learn how they work, why they're important, and how they break down complex tasks. </p>

					<h2>Backpropagation Basics</h2>
					<p>In the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, few algorithms have garnered as much attention and acclaim as backpropagation. Revered for its role in training neural networks, backpropagation is often hailed as the cornerstone of modern deep learning. However, beneath its seemingly complex facade lies a foundation deeply rooted in the elegant principles of multivariable calculus. Understanding its mathematical underpinnings not only demystifies this algorithm but also unveils its remarkable versatility and applications across various domains. In this article, we delve into the intricacies of the backpropagation algorithm, tracing its origins to the realms of calculus while exploring its manifold uses in contemporary machine learning landscapes.</p>
